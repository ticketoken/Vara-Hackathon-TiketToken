## Step 2: Compile and Deploy the Smart Contract

### Rust: You need to have rust 1.80 or newer to be able to compile your contract:

```bash
rustup install 1.81
rustup default 1.81
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
### Compile the smart contract by running the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Once the compilation is complete, locate the `*.opt.wasm` file in the `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release` directory.


## Step 2: Interact with Your Contract on Vara Network

1. To interact with the Gear IDEA and deploy your contract, you will need to download a wallet extension such as [Polkadot-JS](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/), [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz/), or [Subwallet](https://subwallet.app/) to interact with Substrate-based chains.

2. Connect your Substrate wallet to Gear IDE.
3. Upload the `*.opt.wasm` and `metadata.txt` files by clicking the "Upload Program" button.
