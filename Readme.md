## Step 2: Compile and Deploy the Smart Contract

### Compile the smart contract by running the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Once the compilation is complete, locate the `*.opt.wasm` file in the `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release` directory.

2. Connect your Substrate wallet to Gear IDE.
3. Upload the `*.opt.wasm` and `metadata.txt` files by clicking the "Upload Program" button.
